# Survey Builder

## Basics
o-RDS comes with a `Survey Builder` in order to create your surveys. It is a powerful tool that makes it easy to build the perfect survey for you. The `Survey Builder` contains quite a few features in order to help you achieve that. Let's dive into how the `Survey Builder` works.

## Survey Builder Structure
The `Survey Builder` consists of 6 main parts. These parts are: the questions preview, the question settings sidebar, the survey settings, the top status bar, and the publish modal. Each of these parts serve an important role in make the `Survey Builder` run.

### The Question Preview
The first main part you will learn about is the `Question Preview` section. In this section you will see all the questions you have created as well as a button to add questions. This will give you a quick indicator as to what your survey will be like. Let's dive into the questions themselves

#### The Questions
Currently there are 4 types of questions implemented in o-RDS. These include `Multiple Choice`, `Checkbox`, `Fill in the Blank`, and `Short Answer`. These are the 4 questions you'll see when building a survey. You can switch between what question is currently being edited by clicking on the question itself. When you hover over a question, the border with highlight in orange and the once a question is selected it will have an orange border permanently. Additionally, the question's settings will be displayed on the left. 

If you have multiple questions you can change the order of the questions. To do this there are two arrows in the top right portion of a question. The `up` arrow moves the question up one spot, the `down` arrow moves the question down one spot. 

A button that is also in the top right of a question is the delete button. This button will remove the question from the survey forever. `If you accidently remove a question there is no way to recover it!`
